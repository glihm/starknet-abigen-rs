//! This crate contains the definition of traits and types
//! that map to Cairo types.
//!
//! Some of the Cairo types are provided in the ABI event if they are very generic
//! like `Option`, `Result`, etc...
//! This crate provides the `CairoType` implementation for those types and all basic
//! types from Cairo (integers, felt etc...).
//!
